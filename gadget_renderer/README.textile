h2. How to run the Acme Bank / Parsley demo

h3. Acme Bank

Hg repository is at https://fmtstdscm01.thoughtworks.com/acme_bank

* We're still sorting out some bugs with using the plugins in dev mode, so at this point it's best to use RAILS_ENV=production for this application
* run db migration  
* start server with script/https_server as OAuth provider must run over SSL  (server will run on port 5000 HTTPS)
* On first run
** "Sign up" a new user
** login as that user
** give that user some accounts at https://localhost:5000/ 
** setup an OAuth client at https://localhost:5000/oauth/clients  The redirect URI for parsley will be http://localhost:3000/gadgets/oauthcallback

* take a look at the OAuth plugin readme, follow the verification steps at the bottom, and watch the oauth pieces in action. An OAuth protected action is the data action for the parsley.com gadget at https://localhost:5000/accounts/account_info_gadget_data/[account_db_id]

h3. Parsley Dot Com

Git repository is at https://fmtstdscm02.thoughtworks.com/parsley_dot_com

* You must run this application using jruby as we're using Shindig Java libraries.  There's a script at script/jruby
* rake db:migrate
* rake db:seed (DON'T SKIP THIS STEP)
* Start server on port 3000 using script/jruby script/server
* Sign up a new user
* Login as that user
* Setup a new OAuth client at http://localhost:3000/gadgets/oauth_clients
** Gadget URL is https://localhost:5000/accounts/gadgets/account_info.xml
** Client id and secret should match what was generated in Acme Bank
** Service name must be "Provider"  (don't ask)
** Redirect URI must be http://localhost:3000/gadgets/oauthcallback
** Go to http://localhost:3000/ and try to add some gadgets
